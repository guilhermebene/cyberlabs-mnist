# MNIST Digit Classification

In a Python environment or Anaconda environment install PyTorch [here](https://pytorch.org/), the correct command might depend on your OS, environment and Cuda version. You do not necessarily need a GPU to reproduce the results from this project, you can run it on your CPU or Google Colaboratory (as the author of this repository did). In any case, I recommend using Jupyter notebooks to run the code.

Now, if you are using a Python environment in your own machine, install the other necessary dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open `mnist_train2.ipynb` and follow the code. All the necessary explanation and logic for the project is described already inside the notebook.
